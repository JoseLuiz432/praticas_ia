            "i have always been a fan of kettle chips  when you open a bag of kettle chips you know you are going to get quality  these chips are no exception and live up to the name printed on the packagebr br the new york cheddar chips  have a very subtle flavor to them  you can taste the cheddar in them but it doesnt smack you in the face like supermarket brand chips might  the taste lingers as well which is a definite plusbr br another aspect about these kettle chips is the fact every chip is nice and crisp that crunch in your mouth  on top of that there are no burnt chips in any of the bags i have had since the purchase  the only negative i might have is that the flavoring of the chips is uneven  some chips might pack a nice cheddar punch while another might taste rather plain  this isnt a big flaw as it happens when getting seasoned and doesnt ruin the bag at allbr br overall the quality of the chips is fantastic  the flavor is great and you wont be disappointed  especially if you are a cheddar lover\n",
